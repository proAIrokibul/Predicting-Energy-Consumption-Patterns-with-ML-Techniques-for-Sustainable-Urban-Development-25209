# Predicting-Energy-Consumption-Patterns-with-ML-Techniques-for-Sustainable-Urban-Development-25209

This project focuses on leveraging machine learning techniques to analyze and predict energy consumption patterns. The dataset contains 1,000 entries and includes vital features such as solar irradiance, average temperature, wind speed, humidity, cloud cover, atmospheric pressure, sunshine duration, panel orientation, system efficiency, type of renewable system, and energy consumption category. By developing predictive models, this project aims to support sustainable urban development initiatives by enabling efficient energy management and consumption optimization.

## **Project Workflow:**

### 1. **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA):**
   - Insightful visualizations like heatmaps, pair plots, distribution plots, and box plots to understand correlations, outliers, and feature trends.
   - Understanding the relationships between environmental factors (e.g., solar irradiance, wind speed) and energy consumption.

### 2. **Data Preprocessing:**
   - Handled missing values, removed outliers, and encoded categorical variables.
   - Scaled numerical features to ensure compatibility with machine learning algorithms.
   - Splitting data into training and testing sets for unbiased model evaluation.
